## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project, I focused on building a responsive layout using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on relative measurements. 

Key takeaways include:

Responsive Design: I used media queries to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a mobile-friendly experience across devices.

Relative Measurements: I transitioned from fixed units (pixels) to more flexible units like em, rem, %, making the design more scalable and accessible.

Flexbox & CSS Grid: I learned to use Flexbox and CSS Grid to build responsive, fluid layouts that adjust based on screen size.

Mobile-First Approach: By designing for smaller screens first and enhancing for larger ones, I ensured a consistent and accessible experience across devices.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in responsive design and fluid layouts with relative measurements.
